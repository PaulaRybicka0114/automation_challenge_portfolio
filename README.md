# TASK 1 - Software configuration

### Subtask 1 - Why did I choose to participate in the challenge?
Hi! My name is Paulina and since the beginning of 2023 I am learning to become a QA. I started from manual testing first to get the most important basics. Through the process I got interested in quality assurance sector. After several months of learning both I also noticed that it would be helpful if I could understand programming better. It is very important when you want to provide products of the best quality. This naturally led me to automation testing which connects both.

### Subtask 2 - Fixing a problem that displays on the console *(not applicable to everyone)
I was not the one with the problem. :smile:

### Subtask 3 - Adding the code to your own remote repository
Done. :white_check_mark:
