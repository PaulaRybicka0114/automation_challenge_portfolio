# Challenge_Portfolio

# TASK 1 - Software configuration
This task allowed me to:
* perform exploratory testing of the application
* find out what software is needed to start automated testing
* set up my own remote repository on GitHub
* clone the repository and configure the working environment
* format the README file

### Subtask 1 - Why did I choose to participate in the challenge?
Hi! My name is Paulina and since the beginning of 2023 I am learning to become a QA. I started from manual testing first to get the most important basics. Through the process I got interested in quality assurance sector. After several months of learning both I also noticed that it would be helpful if I could understand programming better. It is very important when you want to provide products of the best quality. This naturally led me to automation testing which connects both.

### Subtask 2 - Fixing a problem that displays on the console *(not applicable to everyone)
I was not the one with the problem. :smile:

### Subtask 3 - Adding the code to your own remote repository
Done. :white_check_mark:

### Subtask 4 - Get ISTQB purple test

# TASK 2 - Selectors
This assignment allowed me to:
* learn what selectors are
* learn how to look for them
* learn about xPaths syntax
* understand how to extract the "best" selectors

### Subtask 1 - A new branch
Done!

### Subtask 2 - Searching for selectors on the login page
1. headline_xpath
* //*[@id="__next"]/form/div/div[1]/h5
* //*[text()="Scouts Panel"]
* //h5
2. login_field_xpath
* //*[@name="login"]
* //*[text()="Login"]
* //*[@id='login']
3. password_field_xpath
* //*[contains(@type,"password")]
* //*[text()="Password"]
* //*[@id='password']
4. remind_password_button_xpath
* //*[@id="__next"]/form/div/div[1]/a
* //*[text()="Remind password"]
* //child::div/a
5. change_language_button_xpath
* //*[@id="__next"]/form/div/div[2]/div
* //*[contains(@class,"MuiSelect-root")]
* //*[contains(@data-value,"en")]
6. sign_in_button_xpath
* //*[@id="__next"]/form/div/div[2]/button
* //*[text()="Sign in"]
* //*[@type="submit"]

### Subtask 3 - Adding selectors to the project
Done, feel free to check in files! :wink:

### Subtask 4 - Adding a new file (dashbord)
Same here. :white_check_mark:

### Subtask 5 - Adding a new file (match form)
And here. :white_check_mark:

# TASK 3 - First automatic test and asserts
This assignment allowed me to:
* become more familiar with the framework on which challenge is based
* click on elements on the page
* fill in fields with text
* use assert title
* run a test

### Subtask 1 - Completion of login page
In this subtask, I practised creating methods such as filling a field with text and clicking on page elements.

### Subtask 2 - New test case
In this subtask, I have created a completely new test case, based on what I have learned in previous tasks.

### Subtask 3 - Assert
I have added asserts to my tests.

### Subtask 4 - Repeating what we already know
Repetition of what I already know. :slightly_smiling_face:

### Subtask 5 - Optional task
I used the assert_element_page method, which compares the current text of the element on the page with the expected text.

# TASK 4 - Refactor, debugger and test cases
This task allowed me to:
* perform a code refactor
* learn how to work with the debugger
* design and write test cases
* automate a website on the basis of prepared test cases

### Subtask 1 - Writing test cases
You can check it in [test_cases](test_cases) file.

### Subtask 2 - Code writing based on test cases
Same here!

### Subtask 3 - Adding screencasts of running tests to Google Drive folder
[Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D5-ihJodwfXdP0fAJlziKcpLpiTJibyz?usp=sharing) you can find them. :mag:

### Subtask 4 - Screenshot method and test report
You can check it in [test_cases](test_cases) file.

### Subtask 5 - If else construction
Same here!

# TASK 5 - Robot Framework
This task allowed me to:
* find out what smoke tests are
* learn how to set up suite test
* learn about the new framework
* automatically generate a report

### Subtask 1 - Convert all tests that you performed in the previous task on the Robot Framework
[Here](https://github.com/PaulaRybicka0114/panelscout_robotframework.git) you can check what I did.

# TASK 6 - Bug report and test report
This task allowed me to:
* use projects for the only legitimate purpose - catching bugs
* be familiar with the structure of a properly reported bug
* become familiar with the structure of test reports
* create a repository with a functional portfolio in the README file

### Subtask 1 - Change of environment
Change every link in the project from
https://scouts-test.futbolkolektyw.pl/en/
to this
https://dareit.futbolkolektyw.pl/
### Subtask 2 - Bug report
You can check my short report [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xpmDfykQjTAPjWUDkMjW8yKj0qtOXt3qmN0y8wt4QT4/edit?usp=drive_link).
### Subtask 3 - Test report
You can check it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cfOP8lIohL57nh9vYqMyEPNr9QENP6ThDl3VZ5qbg-s/edit?usp=drive_link).
